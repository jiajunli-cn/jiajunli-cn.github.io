Hello, this is Jiajun Li and my Chinese name is 李嘉俊. I am a PhD student at [Division of Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). My research interests are **political behaviors**, **political psychology**, and **Chinese politics**. Currently, I focus on how social context and disaster memory influence political beliefs and opinions, such as negative experience narratives, political trust, and altruistic nationalism. Methodologically, I incorporate computational methods and large language model simulation into traditional survey and experimental studies.
