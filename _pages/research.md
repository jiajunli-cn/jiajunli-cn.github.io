**Reticence or Theatrics? Grassroots Cadre Presence and Political Response in Surveys** [(View)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5295959)
- Abstract: Survey studies struggle to eliminate response bias, yet they frequently neglect the impact of the interview context. This article investigates the influence of grassroots cadre presence in surveys on self-censorship and social desirability bias. Using the China Family Panel Studies from 2012 to 2018 (N≈100,000), I demonstrate that the presence of grassroots cadres can induce social desirability bias rather than self-censorship in responses to political queries, regardless of whether they are framed positively or negatively. Specifically, treated individuals tend to over-report their trust in grassroots officeholders and local government while under-reporting experiences of unfairness, unreasonable treatment, and conflict with authorities. Novelly, I perform randomized controlled trial simulations (N≈6,000) utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation and In-Context Learning, alongside implicit association tests (N≈100), and findings indicate that social desirability bias is driven by authoritarian cognition (risk perception, fear-based anxiety, suppositional insight, and avoidant tendencies), consistent with the inference that fear of perceived or actual sanctions plays a crucial role in shaping responses.
